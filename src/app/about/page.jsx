              I've fearlessly ventured into the architecture realm, building and scaling applications that reach for the clouds.
              Front-end enchantments? I wield the powers of React, Next, Vue.js, and a trove of CSS spells, from SCSS to CSS modules,
              creating interfaces that are as visually stunning as they are user-friendly.
            </p>

            <p>
              üìä **Database Sorcery**: I've dabbled in the arcane arts of databases,
              from commanding the powerful SQL spirits of MySql and Postgres to forging alliances with the NoSQL guardians like MongoDB, Redis, and DynamoDb.

            <p>
              ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud Chronicles**: Venturing into the digital sky,
              I've harnessed the cloud with the mighty AWS Stack, From storing gems in S3 to optimization of ECS instances and setting up pipelines pulling to add some magic with amazon Glue just before feeding it to amazon RedShift
              Docker and Kubernetes? Oh, I've tamed those creatures too, ensuring that my software creations are as portable as they are powerful.

            </p>
            <p>

              üç∑ **Sipping Code with a Glass of Red**: When the digital realms grow silent, you'll find me savoring life's finer flavors. Red wine, in particular, holds a special place in my heart.
